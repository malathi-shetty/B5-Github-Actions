## Why do we need variables (problem explanation)

Before understanding variables, imagine writing a workflow where you use the same value in many places.

Example:
You want to print your company name in multiple steps.

Without variables:

```
- run: echo "Welcome to KKFUNDA"
- run: echo "KKFUNDA Training"
- run: echo "This is KKFUNDA workflow"
- run: echo "Thanks from KKFUNDA"
```

The problem:

1. The value KKFUNDA is repeated everywhere
2. If you want to change the name, you must update all steps
3. More chances of mistakes
4. Workflow becomes harder to maintain

Another example without variables:

```
- run: echo "Data" > output.txt
- run: cat output.txt
- run: rm output.txt
```

If filename changes, you must edit all steps manually.

Using environment variables solves this problem.

## What are environment variables

Environment variables are key-value pairs used to store reusable values.

Example values:

```
APPNAME: KKFUNDA
FILE: output.txt
CITY: Hyderabad
```

Use them anywhere as:

```
$APPNAME
$FILE
$CITY
```

This avoids duplication and makes workflow cleaner.

## Types of env variables

There are three types:

1. Step level
2. Job level
3. Workflow level

Each has different scope.

---

## Step Level env (with name and on)

Defined inside a single step.
Available only in that one step.

Example:

```
name: Step Level Env Example

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Step level example
        env:
          CITY: Hyderabad
          TRAINER: Prashanth
        run: |
          echo "City is $CITY"
          echo "Trainer is $TRAINER"

      - name: Next step
        run: echo "City is $CITY and Trainer is $TRAINER"
```

Explanation:
Second step cannot access CITY or TRAINER.

---

## Job Level env (with name and on)

Defined at job level.
Used by all steps inside that job.

Example:

```
name: Job Level Env Example

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      COMPANY: KKFUNDA
      COUNTRY: INDIA

    steps:
      - name: Step one
        run: echo "Company is $COMPANY"

      - name: Step two
        run: echo "Country is $COUNTRY"
```

Only steps inside this job can access COMPANY and COUNTRY.

---

## Workflow Level env (with name and on)

Defined at workflow level.
Available to all jobs and all steps.

Example:

```
name: Workflow Level Env Example

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  BRAND: KKFUNDA
  PLATFORM: GitHub

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step in job1
        run: echo "Brand is $BRAND"

  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step in job2
        run: echo "Platform is $PLATFORM"
```

Both job1 and job2 can access BRAND and PLATFORM.

---

## Combined example showing all types (with name and on)

```
name: Full Env Levels Example

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  WF_VAR: WorkflowValue

jobs:
  demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      JOB_VAR: JobValue

    steps:
      - name: Step one with step env
        env:
          STEP_VAR: StepValue
        run: |
          echo "Workflow variable: $WF_VAR"
          echo "Job variable: $JOB_VAR"
          echo "Step variable: $STEP_VAR"

      - name: Step two without step env
        run: |
          echo "Workflow variable: $WF_VAR"
          echo "Job variable: $JOB_VAR"
          echo "Step variable: $STEP_VAR"
```

Explanation:
Step one can access all three variables.
Step two can access workflow and job variables, but not STEP_VAR.
