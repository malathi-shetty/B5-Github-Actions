Multi-line run block (running multiple commands inside a single step)

---

Definition
In GitHub Actions, if you want to run more than one Linux command inside the same step, you use a multi-line run block.

This is done using the pipe symbol (|) after run.

---

Syntax

```
run: |
  command1
  command2
  command3
  ...
```

The pipe symbol continues the command to the next lines.

Example 1
Simple multi-line commands

```
steps:
  - name: Multiple commands in one step
    run: |
      echo "This is line 1"
      echo "This is line 2"
      ls -l
      date
```

Explanation:
All commands run inside the same step, one after another.

---

Example 2
Showing file content after checkout

```
steps:
  - name: Checkout repo
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Show file content and directory
    run: |
      ls -ltr
      cat README.md
      pwd
```

Explanation:
Three Linux commands executed in a single step.

Why use multi-line run block

1. Cleaner workflow
2. Reduces number of steps

How to teach students
Tell them:
Instead of writing four separate steps:

```
- run: echo hello
- run: ls
- run: date
- run: pwd
```

We can combine all using:

```
run: |
  echo hello
  ls
  date
  pwd
```
